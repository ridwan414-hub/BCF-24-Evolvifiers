# Train Booking System - Frontend Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the workflow and key components for implementing the frontend of the train booking system. The frontend will interact with the API gateway to provide user authentication, train data display, and booking functionalities.

## Workflow

1. User Authentication
2. Train Listing and Filtering
3. Individual Train Details and Seat Status
4. Booking Process

## API Gateway

The API gateway service is the central point for frontend communication. It's defined in:



## Implementation Steps

### 1. User Authentication

#### Login and Registration Page
- Create a login form with email and password fields
- Create a registration form with name, email, password, and contact number fields
- Implement form validation
- Send POST requests to the following endpoints:
  - Login: `/api/auth/login`
  - Register: `/api/auth/register`
- Store the returned JWT token for authenticated requests

### 2. Train Listing and Filtering

#### Train List Page
- Fetch train data from `/api/trains` (GET request)
- Display trains in a list or grid format
- Implement filtering options:
  - Date of travel
  - Source station
  - Destination station
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets

### 3. Individual Train Details and Seat Status

#### Train Details Page
- Fetch specific train data from `/api/trains/:trainId` (GET request)
- Display train details:
  - Train number
  - Name
  - Source and destination
  - Departure and arrival times
- Show seat availability status
- Implement a seat map or visual representation of available seats

### 4. Booking Process

#### Booking Form
- Create a booking form with:
  - Passenger details (name, age, gender)
  - Seat selection
- Implement seat selection functionality
- Send booking request to `/api/bookings` (POST request)
- Handle booking confirmation and display booking details

#### Payment Integration
- Integrate with the payment service via `/api/payments`
- Implement a secure payment form
- Handle payment confirmation and update booking status

## Additional Considerations

### State Management
- Use a state management solution (e.g., Redux, MobX, or React Context) for managing application-wide state

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for API requests
- Display user-friendly error messages

### Loading States
- Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations

### Responsive Design
- Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various device sizes

### Accessibility
- Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)

### Testing
- Write unit tests for components and integration tests for key workflows

## Security Considerations

- Implement secure storage for JWT tokens (e.g., HttpOnly cookies)
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement CSRF protection
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks

## Performance Optimization

- Implement code splitting for better load times
- Use lazy loading for images and components
- Optimize API requests with proper caching strategies

By following this guide, you can create a comprehensive frontend for the train booking system that integrates seamlessly with the provided API gateway and microservices architecture.
